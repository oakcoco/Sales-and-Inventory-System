# Sales-and-Inventory-System
Final project for Advance Computer Programming in C++ in Bulacan Agricultural State University. This program is created to fulfill the final requirements in the course subject  (IT-120).

My first program defining how a Sales & Inventory System works using a CSV file.

I'd like to remind everyone who will see this project. It's just a mock program of how should a sales and inventory system works in real world. 
I don't recommend and promote unethical logics of code in real world platform. As i said this is just a mimic project to play fun with.

Play with mistakes. Apply the Lessons.
